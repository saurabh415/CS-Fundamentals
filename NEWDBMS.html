                            Explanation:  The "SQL" contains a comparison known as the "BETWEEN," which is also used in one of the given queries, as you can see. The "BETWEEN" operator is generally used to simplify the "WHERE" clause that is used to specify that the value is greater than one value or greater than some values, less than one or more values.
